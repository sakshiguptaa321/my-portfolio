          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Hi! I’m{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">Sakshi Gupta</span>, a
          final-year B.Tech student majoring in Information Science and
          Engineering at <strong>REVA University</strong>, Bangalore. I’m
          passionate about building clean, responsive web applications and
          combining technology with creativity to solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          My strengths lie in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and
          Javascript programming. I’m currently learning
          <strong> React</strong> and practicing <strong>DSA</strong> to crack
          top tech interviews. Beyond tech, I have a creative side — I’ve worked
          as a freelance graphic designer on Fiverr and collaborated with brands
          as a content creator, leading teams and managing digital campaigns.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          I’m actively involved in hackathons, tech events, and coding contests.
          I also love exploring AI prompt engineering, staying up-to-date with
          new tools, and engaging with developer communities.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Whether it’s designing intuitive user interfaces or automating backend
          logic, I believe in building projects that are both functional and
          delightful to use. I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and take on
          exciting challenges!
